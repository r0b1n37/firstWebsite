            Some ancient call
            That I've answered before
            It lives in my walls
            And it's under the floor
            If this was meant for me, why does it hurt so much?
            And if you're not made for me, why did we fall in love?

            A knock at my door
            I thought I was alone
            Unaware of what I thought I needed
            I drop like a stone
            If I'm not mistaken, then I was the last to know
            And if you return for me, I'd never want for more

            You're dislocated
            Don't be like that
            And you smile when you dive in
            Like you're never coming back
            So hold my body
            Yeah, hold my breath
            See your face when I black out
            I'm never coming back

            Fear of the water
            Fear of the water

            You're dislocated
            Don't be like that
            And you smile when you dive in
            Like you're never coming back
            So hold my body
            Yeah, hold my breath
            See your face when I black out
            I'm never coming back

            You're dislocated
            Don't be like that
            And you smile when you dive in
            Like you're never coming back
            So hold my body
            Yeah, hold my breath
            See your face when I black out
            I'm never coming back

            Fear of the water
